# Introduction

Baseline is a functional library for Roblox that contains a few utilities for creating cleaner initalization scripts. It's a great tool for building client/server scripts for experiences using SSA (single-script architecture), but it's very general purpose and may be appropriate for other applications.

If you're interested, feel free to take a look at the API docs and concepts page for more info!
